All automation in the project is accomplished via GNU make
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf

This is accomplished by nested Makefiles, one per sub-directory. Common
phony targets are decided on so that their invocation at the root of the
project will recurse into all submodules. These include `clean` and `test`.
