The project repository is maintained in a git repository.
http://www.git-scm.com/

As git is decentralized, a server is required to make it collaborative. For
this purpose we have chosen GitHub https://github.com/

The repository is thus currently hosted at
https://github.com/scott-linder/cs4900-quadsolve

Git does not implement locking out portions of the repository, so it is the
responsibility of the developers to communicate what each member is working on.
