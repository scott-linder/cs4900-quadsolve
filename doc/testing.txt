Source is divided into modules to allow for fine-grained unit testing.

Unit testing is implemented for the `validation` and `get_roots` modules.

The `cunit` framework is employed to make testing more uniform; it provides
macros for asserting equalities/inequalities on primitive types, including
floating point types.

Additionally we employ a mocked `sqrt` function to test the `get_roots` module.
